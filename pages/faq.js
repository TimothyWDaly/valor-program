                    <p>
                        The VALOR program conducts multidisciplinary
                        research on the physical and psychological outcomes of warfighters
                        throughout their lifetime. Through our research, we aim that
                        influence health policies on screening, prevention, and
                        intervention practices that improve quality of life, wellness,
                        readiness, and performance of active-duty service members and
                        veterans. Additional information about current VALOR projects can

                        Requirements vary by study and will be described to you before you

                        VALOR Program team for more information.

                    question="How safe is my information if I choose to participate in a VALOR Program study?">
                    <p>
                        We take the safety and security of our participants and their
                        information very seriously. As with all research studies, there is
                        a small risk that some of the personal information of our
                        participants, including answers to survey questions or email
                        addresses, could be compromised. Considerable data-protection
                        safeguards are in place to minimize any compromise of participant
                        data. All data is stored on secure servers in a secure facility,
                        and any data transferred is encrypted according to Department of
                        Defense (DoD) regulations and in line with industry standards. All
                        security procedures meet or exceed DoD standards for the handling
                        and storage of protected health information. The only personnel
                        that have access to this data are a limited group of authorized
                        researchers. Randomly created identification numbers are used
                        instead of names. Each person that has any access to protected
                        health information has been specially trained in the management of
                        protected health information and has signed documents which commit
                        them to protecting protected health information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To further help us protect participant privacy, we have obtained a
                        Certificate of Confidentiality from the U.S. Department of Health
                        and Human Services (DHHS). With this certificate, we cannot be
                        forced to disclose information that may identify participants in
                        any federal, state, local, civil, criminal, legislative,
                        administrative, or other proceeding. We will use the certificate
                        to resist any demands for information that would identify a
                        participant, except to prevent serious harm to the participant or
                        others. A Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent a
                        participant from voluntarily releasing information about
                        themselves or their involvement in the study. A Certificate of
                        Confidentiality does not represent an endorsement of the study by
                        the DHHS or the National Institutes of Health.
