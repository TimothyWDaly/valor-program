                                with special access permissions. These personnel are
                                required to keep the information confidential. They will
                                not share your information with anyone, including

                                To further help us protect participant privacy, we have
                                obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the U.S.
                                Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). With this
                                certificate, we cannot be forced to disclose information
                                that may identify participants in any federal, state,
                                local, civil, criminal, legislative, administrative, or
                                other proceeding. We will use the certificate to resist
                                any demands for information that would identify a
                                participant, except to prevent serious harm to the
                                participant or others. A Certificate of Confidentiality
                                does not prevent a participant from voluntarily releasing
                                information about themselves or their involvement in the
                                study. A Certificate of Confidentiality does not represent
                                an endorsement of the study by the DHHS or the National
                                Institutes of Health.
